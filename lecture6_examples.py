# random call func: 
    # set nx, ny, and ntimesteps
    # set forest zeroes array in dimensions of vars, add two to initiate forest
    # 3d array so iterating over it doesnt erase past
    # start fire at origin position

    # for loop iteration
        # for loop again
            # check state, if on fire
                # check to see if adj tiles can be set on fire
                # check to see if adj tiles are set on fire (+ (probability * 1))
                # set them on fire
                # set current fire to bare

# BONUS POINTS FOR ELEGANT SOLUTIONS
# for pt, (i, j) in enumerate(forest[time,alli,allj]==on fire)    # much less work
# OR
# for pt, (i, j) in enumerate(forest[time, alli, allj]==forested)
