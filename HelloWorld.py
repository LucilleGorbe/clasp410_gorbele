# Welcome back to beautiful, beautiful python, a coding language that, 
#       despite being named after a constricting snake, is anything but restrictive.

# This module is a demonstration of coding language, environment, and operator readiness.
# Print 'Hello World.' to demonstrate functionality.
print('Hello World.')
